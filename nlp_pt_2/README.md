Continutation of nlp_pt_1

NLP with deep learning

* note: many codes are unrefined (particularly in word2vec and GloVe), and unoptimized when it comes to training. goal was just to learn about and practice implementing diff techniques. At the moment, don't recommend using any of this for actual applications.

**Focus:**
- Markov models extended to neural nets
- word2vec
- continuous bag of words
- skip-gram + word2vec
- GloVe 
- various RNN architectures for NLP usage
